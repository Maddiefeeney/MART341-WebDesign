1. Adding a navigation element was new and creating a form element was old. I like adding iframe elements because it is cool to see the video show up and I also enjoy how styling can make a page more detailed and interesting.
2. I am just interested in learning more about styling in general because I like how you can customize a site and I am excited to play around with more styling elements.
