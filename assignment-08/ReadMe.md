## Madeleine Feeney
1. The difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans is that ids help give one name while classes can have multiple. Divs provide structure to group elements together and spans are found inside divs for additional organization. Spans can provide styling or info about content.
2. When using video services like YouTube and Vimeo it can be helpful because the site already has the code you need to embed when sharing.
3. I struggled to figure out adding the multiple source video, but to overcome it I asked Michael and he pointed me to a specific part of the course website that made it easy to fix my issue.
