          The Makah people have been largely affected by the Makah treaty of 1855. This treaty with the US government has had its negative and positive effects on the tribe and the land by limiting their rights and also preserving others which has led to the questioning of whether or not the Makah have the ability to preserve their culture and practices. In this section of my paper, I will be discussing how the Makah tribe has been able to preserve their culture and identity according to resilience theory, along with the things that have caused them to lose important aspects of their culture and current issues that could potentially affect their survival. Resilience is the ability of a community to withstand the economic, social, and environmental issues that it faces and many of these issues are all interconnected, having some sort of impact on the community in the long or short term (Shively n.d.).

The one thing that the Makah wanted more than anything was the right to continue to whale and this was one of the few things that the government allowed the Makah to continue to have rights with, however, the Makah have not whaled freely since the 1930s when they voluntarily stopped whaling (Tanner 2020). This was largely due to the mass commercial whaling activities that brought the species to the brink of extinction and had nothing to do with the activities of the Makah people (IWC n.d.). In 1994, the gray whale was removed from the endangered species list and the Makah announced their desire to resume whaling. This sparked controversy and many were wary of the Makah resuming their practice of hunting whales (Oldham 2003). Although
  the United States government has made it difficult for the Makah to practice their traditions and culture, in 1996 when the Makah began seeking permission to resume whaling the US strongly supported their request. “The first Makah whale hunt in more than 70 years took place on May 10, 1999” (Oldham 2003). But they were deterred from catching a whale due to protestors that day. A few days later on May 17, 1999, the Makah successfully carried out their first whale hunt in 70 years (Vasquez 2005). Following this and since then, anytime the Makah have wanted to resume whaling they have been met with backlash and legal battles with animal rights activists and others who disagree with the Makah’s rights to whale. The number of lawsuits and legal claims that have been made against the Makah to protect the whales is so great that it has created widespread controversy and made it difficult for the Makah to move forward in hunting the whales. These organizations have also worked to distort different components of the treaty and have made arguments that would harm not only the Makah but other tribes as well. Members of Sea Shepherd believe in the validity of their cause and cannot see that what they are fighting for has negative effects on the Makah’s cultural identity (Nijhuis 1998). Organizations have also brought invalid information to light claiming the Makah plan to use 21st-century weapons to hunt the whales and that they are selling the whale meat to the Japanese (Tanner 2020). Although it has been slow, and the Makah’s treaty rights have been violated, their continual pursuit of the ability to whale and obvious passion, demonstrates what an important aspect whaling plays in their cultural identity. During the Treaty of Neah Bay, the Makah ceded approximately 300,000 acres of land to the United States government and in return, one of the few rights the Makah retained was their right to whale (Makah

  n.d.). This action should have been enough for them to prove that they should have the right to whale now that the gray whale population is no longer endangered, but because of people sticking their noses where they do not belong, it has been a much more difficult battle.

Because whaling is not specific to the Makah, there are other countries around the world that whale and have contributed to the view that people have of whaling cultures. For example, the cultural practice of whaling in Norway and Iceland are also known for being controversial because of their disputes with the IWC and their resignations from being member states of the IWC when commercial whaling was banned (Brune 2018). Both of these countries continued to whale after they resigned from the IWC. Both Norway and Iceland rely on commercial whaling as commercial exports to Japan or the meat is used in the tourism industry, but few people in these countries consume whale meat. Japan has also left the IWC recently in 2019 and they have begun commercial whaling again (WDC n.d.). Contrary to popular belief, the Japanese only started eating whale meat after World War II and it is not of much cultural importance to them.

In addition to whaling, fishing has also been an important part of the Makah’s cultural and economic practices. The Makah people have always practiced fishing and they were allowed to continue to fish after the Treaty of Neah Bay was established. Things started to change in the late 1880-18890s when canneries began production on the Puget Sound and surrounding area. Canneries relied heavily on the labor of Asian immigrants and were usually operated by people who were immigrants themselves (Riddle 2014). The canneries created a larger demand for salmon and in turn, these


companies used various contraptions to meet the demand such as fish traps (Ott 2011). By the 1920s salmon populations were very limited due to the various human activities such as the canning companies, but they were also being affected by logging, an increase in popularity of sport fishing, the introduction of dams, and many other factors. Logging was a critical issue for salmon because it contributed to habitat loss. The main salmon species that live in the Neah Bay Area are Coho and Chinook (Hicks n.d.). Both species behave differently so the effects that logging has on each are different. The old-growth forest landscape is critical to the development of juvenile salmon. Large wood debris and logs provide protection and help to create the channel structure. These logs are especially important in the wintertime providing a habitat for the salmon to overwinter in (Hicks n.d.). When loggers are introduced to a habitat, they often disrupt and alter the ecosystem and can remove important parts of the natural environment. Logging can have immediate impacts, but it can also have long-term effects on the habitat that is more difficult to reverse. Even though there have been minor improvements after the government decided that the fisheries be co-managed by both the state and the tribe, if things continue in this way, there will be no winners in this situation (Ott 2011). The salmon populations will go extinct because there has not been enough done to preserve the species.
