      <h2> Web Design Patterns</h2>
      <p> There are many popular web design patterns for layouts to solve problems depending on the type of content we are working with. For example, the Zig-Zag Layout reproduces how the users’ eyes scan a webpage and places the important elements and the “call to action” accordingly. The F-Layout also emulates eye scanning, but is more appropriate for content-heavy sites.

      <p> The most crucial function for a website layout design is structuring the information, so defining the hierarchy of content, whilst ensuring it can be accessed intuitively, are essential objectives that a good layout should accomplish. Although a good layout design should make finding the paths of navigation between web pages easy, it’s not solely about accessibility and discoverability. The layout of a landing page is also extremely important for creating a first impression, and it needs to make an impact that is visual, while conveying the message and story we want to tell the user.
