# Final Project
## Madeleine Feeney
1. I think that something is wrong with my files and that GitHub might be having difficulty opening them? I'm not really sure though becasue everything seems to be uploaded on GitHub when I commit changes. My desktop app says the "Binary file has changed"
2. I also learned more about iframes and getting images to appear in the layout that you want.
3. I struggled with getting my font to appear. To troubleshoot I went back to our lessons on font and realized I wasn't using ''.
