# Assignment 6
## Madeleine Feeney
1. A page can have 6 heads and I would assume an unlimited number of body elements. These elements are different because the head will have headings to identify different sections of the text, while the body is where most of the actual text will reside.
2. Structural Markup shows us how the document is laid out these elements include things like the headings and paragraphs. In contrast, semantic markup is used to emphasize different components of the document so we understand their full meaning. These can be things such as creating citations or bolding certain parts of the text.
3. For this assignment I learned how to create ordered and unordered lists and also how to add semantics to my text.
