1. My imaginary client was a remodeling and interior design business. Their site needed to demonstrate their abilities in remodeling and interior design and also to explain the types of houses and styles that they can work on.
2. Its impotant to consider mobile-first designs becasue more than 50% of people surf the web using their mobile devivces, and that number is only going to continue to grow.
3. The biggest challenge I had was getting the positioning the way I wanted it. For some reason it wasn't working and I think it had something to do with my divs and classes
